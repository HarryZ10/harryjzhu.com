    duties: "As part of my role in developing a 3D marine world game, I was responsible for implementing design specifications and technical limitations. In addition, I established various metrics such as movement speed, object animation speed, object spawn rate, and metric properties of player and enemy objects to ensure a balanced gameplay experience.",
    accomplishments: "I accomplished a variety of tasks while developing 11 Years, a 3D marine survival game where players assume the role of a Clownfish and try to survive in a coral reef ecosystem affected by direct and indirect human influences. One of my main responsibilities was implementing design specifications and technical limitations to help establish the game's overall design and feel. Another significant accomplishment was implementing the Clownfish's ability to eat and complete objectives. Through these efforts, our team aims to educate players about the dire situation in our marine ecosystems and contribute to the climate change dialogue while conveying the experiences that wildlife animals have to endure because of human impact.",

    duties: "During my work on a game development project, I played a crucial role in managing a cross-functional team of seven members by enforcing Scrum and other industry project management frameworks. I oversaw the completion of over 120 deliverables, issues, and feedback to ensure the project stayed on track and met its deadlines. Additionally, I implemented C# scripts for various aspects of the game, such as UI elements, animations, dialogue, music, visual add-ons, and event systems, which contributed significantly to the game's overall functionality and aesthetic. Finally, I corresponded with 11 stakeholders and 9 experts to conduct A/B testing for the minimum viable prototype stages in development, ensuring that the game was refined and met the needs and preferences of its intended audience.",
